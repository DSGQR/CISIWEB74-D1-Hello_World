# CISIWEB74-D1-Hello_World

In order to do well in this course and learn and apply javascript to Web pages, you must demonstrate an understanding of HTML.  The appendix in the back of the text as well as the resources provided should give you an adequate review of basic HTML.  

Create a home page for yourself and post it on the web.  Provide a link to your work.  Your page should be named index.html and written in HTML.  Include your name, a picture of yourself, and a greeting telling the world a little bit about you.  

This project should be posted on the Web and a URL provided.  I suggest using an online service like GitHub https://github.com/ (Links to an external site.) to post your pages, but you are welcome to use any server that allows you to share your pages online.  

Here is a link that explains how to post your html pages on GitHub https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/6127328 (Links to an external site.)

Once you have completed your page and posted it to this discussion, please review the posts of at least two other students and provide them with comments that demonstrate that you have reviewed their links.
