      Hi, I'm Daniel. <br><br>
      Most of my background has typically been in tech one way or another.
      I worked for Apple Inc. for almost 7 years. <br><br> I pretty much hit a ceiling with what I could do with what I knew.
      As a result, I figured the next step would be to get into <br><br> coding/programming. A little over a year ago I enrolled
      in a Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at UC Irvine. I had <br><br> no proir knowledge of coding and to
      say it was an intense course is an understatement. When it came to JavaScript (and <br><br> others) I felt as if there were a lot of gaps in my knowledge. So in order to gain more knowledge and confidence in coding <br><br>
      I decided to take some courses at Chaffey. I was very much hoping this class would be an onsite class but I will take
      what <br><br> I can get.  I have worked many jobs and have a lot of different experiences. I am typically an open book and I very much <br><br> enjoy networking and meeting others that like to grow and better themsleves in one form or another. Feel free to reach <br><br> out anytime by clicking on any of the icons you see to the right of my image. Best of luck to everyone!
